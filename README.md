## What is this?

Practice! These are language agnostic, progressively more challenging problems that were designed to be done in order. That have constraints and stretch goals to get the solver to try explore different programming techniques and features of whatever languages they use.

## Info:

Each numbered directory contains language specific subdirectories with solutions in their respective language.

Python and Ruby solutions, thus far, don't use third-party libraries, so you should be able to easily run them locally if you have Python and Ruby installed. Alternatively, here are online REPLs for [Python](https://repl.it/languages/Python3) and [Ruby](https://repl.it/languages/Ruby). For the JavaScript solutions, copy and paste into your web browser's console.

## Work in progress:

The most mature solutions are in Python. I'll add mroe solutions and improve upon earlier ones as time permits.
